## Vision

The Edo State Government, in a bid to eradicate illegal migration and promote economic prosperity and safety for its citizens have designed the â€˜Managing Migration through Developmentâ€™ programme. The objective of this programme is set against four thematic pillars which aligns with the Edo State overall development strategic plan. The interventions articulated in this document have been designed through collaborative efforts and wide consultations with local and international bodies. Alongside the ongoing response of the State Government to the issues that have prompted this programme, we welcome input, partnerships and support in order to make the desired programme outcome a reality for the people of Edo State so as to effectively eradicate Illegal migration and human trafficking in Edo State.
